Beneath the sun, on fields of green,
A battle’s fought with spirit keen.
The willow sings, the leather flies,
As cheers and hopes together rise.

The bowler’s glare, the batter’s stance,
Each ball a tale, each shot a chance.
The crowd erupts, the stumps alight,
A dance of day that steals the night.
In every heart, the game does stay—
Cricket’s soul shall never fade away.
